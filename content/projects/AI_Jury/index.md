This project presents a **Jury Deliberation Simulator**, an interactive AI-driven environment designed to study **group reasoning, persuasion, and decision-making** in a courtroom-like setting.  
Inspired by the dynamics of *12 Angry Men*, the simulator models how multiple jurors—each represented by an autonomous large language model—debate, form opinions, and eventually reach a verdict.

The goal is to explore how different personalities, background knowledge, and reasoning styles interact to influence group consensus and fairness.  
It can serve as a research tool for studying **multi-agent dialogue**, **argumentation**, and **ethical reasoning** under conflicting evidence.

### Key Features
- 🧠 **LLM Agents:** Each juror is powered by a distinct reasoning model with memory and personality.
- ⚖️ **Dynamic Debate:** Simulates persuasion, bias shifts, and majority formation during deliberation.
- 📊 **Behavior Analysis:** Logs conversation flow and verdict progression for visualization and study.
- 🧩 **Research Application:** Useful for studying human-AI interaction and decision-making systems.
