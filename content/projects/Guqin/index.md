title: 'Research on simulating guqin string movement at DKU'
summary: 'Formulated and solved a nonlinear wave PDE with fourth-order bending stiffness and viscoelastic damping, discretized via finite-difference stencils and integrated using Runge–Kutta (RK4). Built a C + Python hybrid solver with FFT-based spectral analysis and Lyapunov-exponent estimation, quantifying the onset of chaos in plucked-string motion.'

1. Formulated and solved a nonlinear wave PDE with fourth-order bending stiffness and viscoelastic damping, discretized via finite-difference stencils and integrated using Runge–Kutta (RK4).
2. Built a C + Python hybrid solver with FFT-based spectral analysis and Lyapunov-exponent estimation, quantifying the onset of chaos in plucked-string motion.
3. Verified model correctness through energy-conservation and spectral-stationarity tests, then mapped the stiffness–chaos transition, observing Lyapunov growth consistent with theoretical predictions.
4. Delivered physically interpretable results connecting numerical dynamics and acoustic timbre, informing nonlinear modeling of traditional instruments.
