I started learning to cook because I’m used to Chinese food and found it hard to adjust to local dishes when studying at Duke. Instead of giving up, I taught myself using recipes and videos on Redbook. Cooking unexpectedly helped me make friends — we cooked together every weekend. It was a wonderful way to bring people together, share laughter, and feel a small sense of accomplishment. Of course, we sometimes argued in the kitchen, but once the dishes were done, everything turned into laughter.

After my friends went back to China, I began cooking alone. It felt different — I learned to chase away flies drawn to my food, balance my time between cooking and studying, and enjoy the quiet process. From shopping for ingredients to cooking and eating, I realized that cooking is one of the best ways to relax and recharge.

My favorite dish is steak — the only dish I learned before coming to China. Learning how to make steak tender but not raw, adjusting for thickness and tools, taught me that small details make a big difference.

I also love braised beef. Understanding how to cook meat properly helps with many other dishes, like spicy stewed oxtail or tomato potato tendon stew.

1. The first step is removing the smell by either searing or boiling. Then rinse it with hot water to remove any cooked blood. 

2. Next, add flavor — use high heat to seal the meat, add spices (star anise, cinnamon, chili, ginger) with enough oil, then add soy sauce for saltiness. 

3. Finally, add water and simmer on low heat overnight. 

4. Don’t forget to add vegetables about 30 minutes before serving!

The hardest dish for me is 酱香饼 (savory sauce pancake), a local snack everywhere in China, but can’t find anywhere outside. It’s very difficult to make — I tried at least 20 times before getting it right. The dough’s water ratio, the resting time for elasticity, and the kneading technique all require patience and reflection. Many online tutorials don’t explain whether to use high-, medium-, or low-gluten flour, which is why my first few attempts failed — the texture wasn’t crispy and lacked the layered structure. Luckily, I made it!
