I was once the **Shanghai 100-meter Women’s Hurdles Champion** during my junior and senior school years.  
I am also a **National Level II Athlete** in both **100-meter hurdles** and **100-meter sprint**. 
I started learning hurdles in **third grade**, when my parents simply wanted me to build a habit of exercising.  
Fortunately, with the guidance of my coaches — **Liou Tang, Shuping Han, and Director Fang** — I later trained under **Haiping Sun**, the national coach who also trained **Liu Xiang**, China’s first Olympic gold medalist in the men’s 110-meter hurdles.


## 🥇 Facing Fear and Learning Courage

I began hurdling in **Grade 5**. At first, I was terrified of the hurdles.  
During winter training, I fell almost every day — crashing into the hurdles and rolling across the track.  
Luckily, the thick winter clothes protected my body, but not my confidence.  
Each time I approached a hurdle, I jumped too high, afraid of getting hurt.

Later, I realized I had some natural talent for this sport.  
Watching Olympic replays, I noticed that even top athletes often knock down hurdles — **seven out of ten times!**  
Then it clicked: what matters is not avoiding the hurdle, but **maintaining speed**.  
If you stay low and fast, hitting a hurdle doesn’t slow you down much.  
From that moment, I learned that **fear never helps — only facing and flowing through obstacles does**.

## 🧠 Technique, Reflection, and Growth

When I became the **Shanghai 100-meter hurdles champion**, I met **Coach Haiping Sun**, the legendary mentor of Liu Xiang.  
Training with him changed how I understood athletics.  
I realized that my strength wasn’t only physical — it was also **mental**.  
Hurdles demand both **technique and reflection**, not just endurance.

Coach Sun constantly reminded me of precision:  
> “Send your hips forward, whip your leg down instantly!”

That movement — quick, sharp, and rhythmic — minimized speed loss and kept me gliding.  

From Coach Sun, I learned that **mastery comes from learning the same thing through different perspectives** — every teacher shapes a unique part of who you become.


## ⚖️ Balance between Study and Running
I didn’t have good grades in primary school, but athletic training taught me how to improve.
Because I had limited time to study, I tried every possible way to finish my homework before school ended — even during breaks.
I also found that exercising was a great way to refresh my mind and stay focused.

Now, I enjoy **hiking, boxing, TRX, and weight training** — not for medals, but for strength, clarity, and joy.
